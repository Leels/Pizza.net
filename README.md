# Pizza.net
## By Lela Smith

### Description
#### This website will allow the user to order a pizza from Cyperspace. The site will grab the user's information for delivery then show a page to submit the order. User can choose the size of pizza, crust type, toppings and beverage options. User may also order a second pizza if they wish. The site will determine the price of the order depending on the previous selections and will display the price along with the order information. Finally a confirmation page will display confirming the order. With this site I hope to make Sandra Bullock proud.
